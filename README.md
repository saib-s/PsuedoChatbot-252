TO RUN
1) Run 'rasa shell'
2) that's it!

Suggested input to get a quick idea of what this bot can do:
- Hello
- Can I have a fantasy book recommendation
- Give me a comedy book
- Can you be more specific
- What have you read
- What book have I read
- I read a book the other day
- Beyonders by Brandon Mull
- It was pretty great!
- What book have I read

Currently accepted:
- Hello
- Goodbye
- How are you 
- Help
- Asking for recommendations in the following genres: fantasy, sci-fi, YA, kids, historical fiction, romance, horror, comedy, serious
- Tell me a book fact
- Tell me a joke
- I read a book today (opens a form, stores info on recent book read by user)
- Two points where the user can ask for more info:
- one is when asking for a specific recommendation for comedy books, added this one so we can scale up with lists of book recommendations
- one is when asking for clarification about a claim about a horror author, added so we can provide info about authors, not just books
